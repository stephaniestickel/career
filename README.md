While navigating my rapidly unfolding career path, I have decided to take a moment to step back and not get swept up in the daily tasks that I focus so much of my time and efforts on to comprehend how my current work will impact my career in the long-run.

Not an easy task, as many engineers will agree. Context switching takes excessive stamina, especially for those who are deep in the technical details of a few non-overlapping projects, but as I've heard and am learning, it *does* get easier with time and thoughtful practice. I would say experience, but I have found that many go from meeting to meeting without consciously taking in details and ideas (I like to write down notes during and after meetings to ensure I don't forget the progress or new paths forward for the project) before heading into the next meeting. 

These people mainly fall into two categories: 1) they have the experience s.t. the meeting's purpose is intended to provide other's with insight in a field they would be considered a Subject Matter Expert (SME), and 2) they have grown comfortable with their sufficient level of knowledge and understanding that they are no longer actively trying to learn underlying or obscure concepts since they do not affect their daily lives.

As an eternal n00b, I strive to take and digest as much material as possible so that I can contribute to working on cutting-edge research and technology. I started off my career hungry to devour any and all technical material I could get my hands on and ask my peers for their insight; however, I quickly learned that this is not the most effective strategy to attain my goal.

I learned I had to use my time strategically and deliberately. It simply wasn't possible to sit in every meeting or read every paper and take extensive notes on every technical concept I had not yet encountered. I had to be deliberate with which fields I wanted to focus on and which I had the "career capital" (<i>So Good They Can't Ignore You</i>, Cal Newport) to be able to contribute to.

Essentially, Newport defines career capital as a combination of your specific skills in rare and valuable fields. He has a glossary at the end of his book which I find incredibly useful, although I did highlight and take notes in the margins throughout the pages.

While beginning to take a step back from my career, I have decided to document what so many people face in their working lives. Critical decisions that can ultimately change your career trajectory and the uncertainty that comes with making bold moves. Although I use the word "critical", these decisions may take the form of exploring a side project in your free time, selecting and rejecting projects to work on in your career, and initiating your own research in a field you have enough career capital in to advance what we now consider the cutting-edge.

My next page will dive into analysis of my own path up to this point: the opportunities I chose to pursue, the extratcurriculars that I was able to take lessons from and apply to my career (spoiler: cheerleading in tech?!), and how I evaluated my options based on my previous experience compared to how they factored into my current state and how I would weigh them now.
